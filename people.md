amount true progress Viktor (with his company) brought to forever
lagging industries in Latvia.

### Andrey Kazakov [ZRA ELLAT](https://www.ellat.lv)

Even older school Engineer with mystical powers to find pleasure 
in what He does day to day.

better have a screwdriver if You call yourself an engineer in proximity to Andrey.

### Martin Puutka [mapuut.net](https://mapuut.net)

New school undergraduate bachelor or engineer or whatever. Regardless
of lacking official education a good self-educated person, and 
superb web dev.  
Oddly rare person who actually enjoys `CSS`. Most devs run from it. 
Can call Him Martin the **CSS king**

### Artur Karbone [http://craftsmanatwork.guru/](http://craftsmanatwork.guru/)

Solid Engineer, very straightforward and aim driven. Currently
being a software architect at some place. Need a hand inside `C#` ecosystem, 
can ping Him, or if You can't decide between 760 or A8.  
Has a rare quality to tell customers, that maybe that deep and complete automation 
of whatever would never even break even. Artur the honest Dev.

### David Alajanjan [Riddec OU](https://riddec.com)

Young entrepreneur with fair attitude 
towards people. Witnessed good resolutions of sketchy situations. 
Very light and fast in communication. Light, is a good summary for David.
