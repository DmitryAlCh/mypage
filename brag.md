It is considered bad to brag about yourself, from place and time where I a from.
>"Your doings should speak for You." 
> -- <cite>common thinking pattern</cite>

I have worked with outstanding people both skill wise and work ethic wise. Whose doings have societal importance 
of unimaginable level. Not talking about doctors or firefighters, - am talking about engineers.
Who make electricity appear in outlets, make water running in taps, and waste 
flushing away from WCs all over the countries. Nobody knows these people. And their doings are 
silent.  

Hence I suggest to brag more. Does not matter openly or in the bedroom alone. 
You did something - brag about it. No idea what happens on psychological level, 
common sense tells, that feeling of accomplishment is healthier than feeling
nothing or worse.  

Funny how I needed this explanation before starting to actually praise myself :)
Actual brag:

* Have engineer degree in electronics and radio. 
* Worked in 2 most successful Latvian industrial electronics manufacturers
* Successfully taught people to operate on complex equipment
* Left a small town without water once
* Automated really important facilities
* Lost and Won fights, in amateur Wushu tournaments
* Am married for 10+ years with same wife
* Gotten fat and gotten slim (almost)
* Actually earned some money as freelancer on upwork
* Figured out all media (news) is a [`copy`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting)
* Am able to compile vague requirements to something more concise and elegant  

Felt better about myself. Maybe try it too.
