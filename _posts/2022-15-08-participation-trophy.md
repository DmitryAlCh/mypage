I took some part in some amatuer fighting events, so called "open ring" events and
tournaments. Fighters of all ages and skill where welcomed, needed to pay symbolic fee 
and pass the doctor before the event. 

So it looked harsh at times, gyms where event took place were not always fancy, 
places were always packed, scary people and etc. The matchmaking, the fightcard, the 
waiting time for Your turn, intimidateng to say the least. Yet noone complains.
Everyine is tough :)

And then You hear the coaches talk on prizes, they don't argue a second, on giving 
every kid who stepped to the ring a prize.
