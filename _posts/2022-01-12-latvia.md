Once speculated on Latvia's biggest mistake in [post on elections]({% post_url
2022-30-09-elections%}), that is **non-citizens**. Originally wanted to blame
Latvia and call Latvian government names, with links and numbers. But thoughts
took an unexpected turn.  
**TLDR**: know what is good for You.

Many people, including myself, were non-citizens of Latvia. Not adding all
links on non-citizen count and differences in rights, because it is not that
relevant. The important point is, - I believe most affected people **felt** becoming
a non-citizen as **injustice**. I certainly did.

There is an official and lawful justification for creating non-citizens in
Latvia. And I believe there are many people Who would call it **just**,
otherwise there would be no calling to create such a category of people.

That was done on purpose to spark emotions. "They" spark
emotions in order to lower cognitive abilities of population. One significant
part of people is offended/angry, other - bigger part of people is somewhat
excited, both blinded by emotions.  

Keeping people blinded appears to be a continuous endeavor, because "they" never
stop suggesting people go into emotional mode. Always new thing to make
people angry/sad/excited. I used to think that dividing people was the main
reason aka **Divide and conquer**. But it appears to be just a byproduct of
keeping people emotional. If "Happiness" would last longer and cost less,
"they" would keep Us happy.

Recently We all saw "fear" emotion in action. During the recent widely spread
illness. When unprecedented illness fighting measures were taken, and
unbelievable level of obedience from the population was shown.

Sales people know it, and prefer customers to being emotional. Throw something like 
"emotions that drive sales", in a web search engine.

How many people even know their best interests? Hence people are kindly
provided with plenty of interests to choose from: sports, national interests, European
Union interests, WEF interests ant etc.  

Worst part, is that even if "They" disappear tomorrow, people that 
are used to be "angry" all the time, are still here. I am still here, and I still 
**feel** robbed when received Aliens passport ~22 years ago(half-joke).

It is some big football(soccer) event happening right now, and player X, just
beat some previous achievement of past football player Y. We should really
focus on deciding/discussing who is the greatest of those two. This discussion
should be taken seriously, with deep historical context and facts. Now go and
spend a day/week thinking about this.

Stay sane.
