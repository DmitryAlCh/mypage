I never understood people pursuing non-engineering careers, made no sense to Me.
You need to work in real economy, produce something, build houses, etc. Which in my head 
equated to being a builder/electrician/software engineer.  
**TLDR**: Why people working real jobs are paid less? -> The expect guidance.

For example consider a new "mall" building process. All engineers start when they are told to start. 
Even the elite of elites - architects, receive a task to draw a "mall", afterwards the rest 
come in, with water supply, electricity, gas etc. 

They have their degrees in their fields, and "wait" for someone to decide to 
build a "mall". They will work hard to prepare quotes for tenders, yes. But the pie size is defined 
at this point already.

Some might argue that "deciders" need engineers to build the "mall". Yes they do. 
That is why engineers are getting paid a bit more than average workers.

The main "decider" deals with biggest ambiguity/complexity/unknown and gets the biggest reward. 
The next in line, "architect" deals with still big, but lesser complexity, so history might even remember the name.
The rest get peanuts as compensation and no recognition.

It is so obvious, but it took Me almost 2 decades to figure this out. It is not about engineers either, 
not even employees vs owners. You can own a company, that does roofing, and still wait for tenders to be published.
So service providers vs "deciders".

Yes the "decider" looks very similar to "capital" that only wants to multiply, and will never stop.
While it might be true, it takes away discussion from person to some abstract entities. 
Moreover, what is more important, puts person in a "waiting guidance" position.

The big and scary question: what would I do, given the capital or left alone without need to work.
What would I decide? What would You decide?
