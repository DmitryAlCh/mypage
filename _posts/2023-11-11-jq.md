Either You have a stringified JSON from somewhere, and You want it to look fancy,
or only some fields from huge JSON are needed - <a name="jq">`jq` to the rescue.   
**TLDR:** start here [jq cheat sheet](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/jq)

### Simplest case make stringified JSON great again
As simple as piping stringified JSON to `jq` would produce a nicely formatted output in terminal, like:

```
echo '{"id":1000,"name":"Dmitry","country":"ME","timeZone":"UTC+X","matches":{}}' | jq
```
```
{
  "id": 1000,
  "name": "Dmitry",
  "country": "ME",
  "timeZone": "UTC+X",
  "matches": {}
}
```
You can continue piping it further to next application or a file, as usually with console applications. 
To see real benefits we need to add "query" to `jq`. Query is added in single quotes, as `jq 'some query'`.
Some of allowed "special" symbols are: `{}` for dictionary, `[]` for an array.

### Take only certain JSON keys
We can get both `keys` & `values` or only `value` we care for. Syntax for both
`key` & `value` is `jq '{key1, key2}'` 

```
echo '{"id":1000,"name":"Dmitry","country":"ME","timeZone":"UTC+X","matches":{}}' | jq '{id, name}'
```
```
{
  "id": 1000,
  "name": "Dmitry"
}
```
and for `value` - `jq '.key1, key2'`.

```
echo '{"id":1000,"name":"Dmitry","country":"ME","timeZone":"UTC+X","matches":{}}' | jq '.id, .name'
```
```
1000
"Dmitry"
```

### Take only certain deeply nested JSON keys
Nested property `matches` is an object itself and may contain `key-values`. Like here:
```
{
  "id": 1000,
  "name": "Dmitry",
  "country": "ME",
  "timeZone": "UTC+X",
  "matches": {
    "infoSec": false,
    "paySec": [
      {
        "id": 12
      },
      {
        "id": 998
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Say we care only for `paySec`, the query to get both `keys` & `values` would be:  
`jq '.matches | {paySec}'` we piping inside query with `|`.

```
echo '{"id":1000,"name":"Dmitry","country":"ME","timeZone":"UTC+X","matches":{"infoSec":false,"paySec":[{"id":12},{"id":998}]}}' | jq '.matches | {paySec}'
```
```
{
  "paySec": [
    {
      "id": 12
    },
    {
      "id": 998
    }
  ]
}
```
and for `values` only:  
`jq '.matches | .paysec'`

```
echo '{"id":1000,"name":"Dmitry","country":"ME","timeZone":"UTC+X","matches":{"infoSec":false,"paySec":[{"id":12},{"id":998}]}}' | jq '.matches | .paySec'
```
```
[
  {
    "id": 12
  },
  {
    "id": 998
  }
]
```
### Take only certain keys from different JSON nesting levels
Real life scenario most likely would require having a user `id` from top level and his `matches` on `paysec` from nested properties, omitting other `key-values`.
The tricky part is that we need to make a remap in a query with `:`. So the query syntax would be be:
`jq '{id, matches: matches | {paysec}}'`

```
echo '{"id":1000,"name":"Dmitry","country":"ME","timeZone":"UTC+X","matches":{"infoSec":false,"paySec":[{"id":12},{"id":998}]}}' | jq '{id, matches: .matches | {paySec}}'
```
```
{
  "id": 1000,
  "matches": {
    "paySec": [
      {
        "id": 12
      },
      {
        "id": 998
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Once we started remapping, we can flatten is further with by making `matches` -> `paySecMatches` and skipping the `paySec` key.
The query: `jq '{id, paySecMatches: .matches | .paySec}'`

```
echo '{"id":1000,"name":"Dmitry","country":"ME","timeZone":"UTC+X","matches":{"infoSec":false,"paySec":[{"id":12},{"id":998}]}}' | jq '{id, paySecMatches: .matches | .paySec}' 
```
```
{
  "id": 1000,
  "paySecMatches": [
    {
      "id": 12
    },
    {
      "id": 998
    }
  ]
}
```
### Accessing and flattening Arrays 
Need to add `[]` as an array symbol to a key, to tell `jq` we are accessing or creating an array.  
To flatten such array `{ list: [ { id: 1 },{ id: 2 } ] }`  
into `{flatList: [1, 2]}` we do:
`jq '{list: [.list[] | .id]}'`, what stands for: "give Me a dictionary, with single property `flatList`, that is an `array`, 
consisting of values from `list` array's values gotten by `id` key".
```
echo '{"list": [{"id":1},{"id":2}]}' | jq '{flatList:[.list[] | .id]}'
```
```
{
  "flatList": [
    1,
    2
  ]
}
```
### Wrap up
`jq` allows even `select` type queries and `math`, but never had to dive that deep. While the syntax takes time to grasp,
still better than to write `javascript` throw-away code.
