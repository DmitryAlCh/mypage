#### Entering and staying

For EU citizens no visas needed. EU citizens can stay for up to 90 days. Then 
need to leave and enter Montenegro once more, to get another 90 days of stay.
During the stay need to register at place of stay (physical address or "tourist Apartman" name).
Registration happens at Tourist info centers, and is 1 EUR per day per Adult. Although 
kids are freed from fees, need to register them also. ID cards are not an ID here, 
only passport.

#### Renting

Internet services and "apps" are not too developed in Montenegro, so there are 
several options: 
* airbnb
* [realitica.com](https://realitica.com) there are rumors that locals use it.
