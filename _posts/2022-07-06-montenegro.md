#### Entering and staying

For EU citizens no visas needed. EU citizens can stay for up to 90 days. Then 
need to leave and enter Montenegro once more, to get another 90 days of stay.
During the stay need to register at place of stay (physical address or "tourist Apartman" name).
Registration happens at Tourist info centers, and is 1 EUR per day per Adult. Although 
kids are freed from fees, need to register them also. ID cards are not an ID here, 
only passport.

#### Renting

Internet services and "apps" are not too developed in Montenegro, so there are 
several options: 
* airbnb
* [realitica.com](https://realitica.com) there are rumors that locals use it.

### Language

Once my [CTO](/people/#andrey-kazakov) told Me a legend that christian missionaries in Africa, when spread the crhistian religion,
they needed to speak to locals, so they developed a "missionary dictionary" it had 
the absolute minimum to get by, and do the job. Legend claimed it was several hundreds of words.
Could not search online for that "missionaries dictionary".
But found a polyhlot person
[Petrov Dmitry](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%94%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%AE%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87_(%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BA)),
method claims You need 350-400 words to get by in any country. Examining the method itself, is too long,
so this [article](https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/6064ef5edcc34c67f636d280/kakie-slova-nujno-znat-chtoby-razgovarivat-na-liubom-iazyke-metod-petrova-poliglot-6087110c391ac940906eafeb) gives the summary.
